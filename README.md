# drtlemon AI

**drtlemon AI** by **Daramola Olasupo** · **StoneWeb InFOMIX Enterprises** is a fully air-gapped, zero-dependency, plug-and-play local AI environment designed to run seamlessly from your **local hard drive** or a **portable USB/SSD**. It bypasses complex installations — natively executing large language models, image generation, and high-quality text-to-speech directly on your hardware with no internet required.

With a unified architecture, you can initialize your AI models once and carry them with you across **Windows, macOS, and Linux**.

## One-Liner Install

```bash
curl -sL https://github.com/Drstone0007/drtlemon-ai/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz | tar xz && cd drtlemon-ai-main && bash install.sh
```

## Core Features

*   **Multi-Modal AI Hub:** A single interface for **Text Chat**, **Image Generation**, and **Text-to-Speech**.
*   **Zero Dependency Setup:** Ships with portable Python and isolated engine binaries. No system permissions, registry edits, or package managers required.
*   **Cross-Platform:** Uses an intelligent `Shared` volume system — download your AI models *once*, and use them natively on Windows, macOS, and Linux without duplication.
*   **Fully Offline:** Runs completely air-gapped after initial setup. Your data never leaves your machine.
*   **Network Proxied UI:** The custom Python HTTP server serves a blazing-fast dark mode UI. Access the AI from your phone or tablet on the same WiFi — no CORS headaches.
*   **Hardware Accelerated:** Natively capitalizes on AVX CPU instructions, NVIDIA CUDA, or Apple Metal GPU accelerators dynamically when plugged into different host machines.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Initialize & Download
Run the install script for your OS. This will download the execution engines and your selected models.

| OS | Command |
|---|---|
| **Windows** | Double-click `Windows/install.bat` |
| **macOS** | Open Terminal -> drag `Mac/install.command` -> Enter |
| **Linux** | `bash Linux/install.sh` |

### Step 2: Launch
| OS | Command |
|---|---|
| **Windows** | `Windows/start-fast-chat.bat` |
| **macOS** | `Mac/start.command` |
| **Linux** | `bash Linux/start.sh` |

The server will start, and your default browser will open to `http://localhost:3333`.

---

## LAN Mobile Access

Use your PC's AI from your phone or tablet on the same network:

1. Ensure the app is running on your PC.
2. The terminal will show a **Network Access** IP (e.g., `http://192.168.1.15:3333`).
3. Open that URL on your mobile browser.
4. Generate text, images, or speech directly from your mobile device!

## FreeQwenApi: Free LLM Access (Zero-Cost Qwen)

[drtlemon AI] includes built-in support for **FreeQwenApi** — a local OpenAI-compatible proxy that gives you **free access to Qwen Chat models** (qwen3.7-max, qwen3.7-plus, qwen-turbo-latest).

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/y13sint/FreeQwenApi.git /tmp/FreeQwenApi
cd /tmp/FreeQwenApi
npm install
npx tsx src/proxy.ts
```

The proxy runs at `http://localhost:3264/api`. Switch to it in the **Models** panel by selecting any Qwen model, or configure via Settings → Provider → FreeQwenApi.

### Features
- **Completely free** — proxies Qwen Chat's free tier, no API key required
- **OpenAI-compatible** — works with any OpenAI SDK by changing the base URL
- **Multiple modes**: Chat (default), Image Generation, Video Generation
- **Qwen 3.7** models with up to 128K context and reasoning capabilities

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| Image Engine "Not Ready" | Stop the Chat Engine using the **"Stop Chat Engine"** button in the Image panel to free up RAM. |
| TTS Engine "Not Installed" | Re-run the `install` script to ensure the Piper binary was extracted correctly. |
| "Engine Not Found" | Ensure you ran the `install` script before the `start` script. |
| Slow Generation | The model may be too large for your RAM. Try a smaller model (e.g., Gemma 2 2B). |
